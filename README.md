projects
========
My upcoming Opensource contribution would be a python library called "NotEngine", which can be plugged in to any project(e.g Django project) and used for GCM, APNS, EMAIL and SMS stuffs for the Notification.

This will include a web dashboard where users(Developers) can configure the necessary parameters.

This NotEngine is backed by the most popular key-value cache and store REDIS.

This NotEngine also includes a rule engine where rules/conditions can be configured for the Notifications.
